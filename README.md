# py

This is my first utilisation of the Flask Python framework.

The aim of this task was to implement a login system that also hashes passwords sent to the database and provides user authentication

Where this project varies from the standard login system is that there is an additional type of user that is able to access the service. Which prompted me to create different means of signing up the two different kinds of users and granting them access on successful login after queiring different tables for validation.
